# Data Collection and Evaluation 

## Data Collection
The Certificates are offered with the financial support by Upskill Canada, powered by Palette Skills, made possible through funding from the Government of Canada.

As part of Upskill Canada, we have committed to tracking shared outcomes that will see job seekers from all diverse professional and lived experiences have access to greater career opportunities. The information you share in surveys will help us monitor our progress toward those shared outcomes and make improvements. With that said, we are committed to protecting your privacy. All responses will be kept confidential and only be reported to our funder or externally at an aggregate or summary level where it will not be possible to identify any individual response. All data will be stored and disidentified following the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). Personal information that you provide to the University is collected pursuant to section 2(14) of the University of Toronto Act, 1971. At all times your personal information will be protected in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. If you have questions about these policies, please refer to https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/privacy, or contact the University Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator at https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/contact-us. Please contact Curtis Norman (curtis.norman@utoronto.ca) before completing the survey if you have any concerns.
We are committed to continuous improvement of our certificate. Your feedback is crucial in helping us enhance the learning experience. 

Throughout this 16-week process, we kindly request you to take some time to provide your insights through our certificate evaluation process. Please note: All survey responses will be kept confidential and individual, identifiable data will not be shared publicly.  

## Evaluation

* Pre-Certificate Survey: Before the certificate officially begins, you are required to complete our pre-Certificate survey. This survey is designed to gather information about your background, expectations, and goals. Your responses will help us tailor the certificate to better meet your needs and evaluate participant growth by the end of the certificate. 

* Mid-Certificate Surveys: Through your Certificate experience, the DSI team will send you surveys focused on your Certificate experience, your learning, and the delivery of the learning modules. These surveys all us to iterate and engage in continous improvement of the Certificates.  

* Post-Certificate Survey: Following the end of the final learning module, you will receive a Post-Certificate Survey which includes questions about your learning experience, your career transitions, and skills development. Participants are required to complete this survey as part of our reporting commitments as well as to improve the Certificates for future iterations.
