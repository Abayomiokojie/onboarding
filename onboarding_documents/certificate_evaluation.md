# Certificate Evaluation 

We are committed to continuous improvement of our certificate. Your feedback is crucial in helping us enhance the learning experience. Throughout this 16-week process, we kindly request you to take some time to provide your insights through our certificate evaluation process. Please note: All survey responses will be kept confidential and individual, identifiable data will not be shared publicly.  

* Intake Survey: Before the certificate officially begins, you are required to take our intake survey. This survey is designed to gather information about your background, expectations, and goals. Your responses will help us tailor the certificate to better meet your needs and evaluate how much you’ve changed by the end of the certificate. 

* Mid-Point Survey: Around the midpoint of the certificate, you will be asked to complete a mid-point evaluation survey. This provides an opportunity to share your thoughts on the content, delivery, and overall experience thus far. 

* End-of-Certificate Evaluation: Upon completion of the certificate, you will receive an end-of-certificate evaluation form. This comprehensive survey will cover various aspects of the certificate, including module content, technical facilitator effectiveness, and certificate logistics, as well as competency questions to determine the certificate’s impact on your knowledge. 

* Post Certificate Survey: We value your journey beyond certificate completion. After finishing the certificate, we will invite you to participate in the mandatory post-certificate survey to capture insights into your post certificate experiences including your current employment status and salary.  

We will include the links to each survey here once they are available and will also email them to all learners.
