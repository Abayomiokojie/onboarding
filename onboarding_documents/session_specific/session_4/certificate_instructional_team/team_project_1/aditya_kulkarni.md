Hello Folks! I am Adi and I will be graduating with a Computer Science (Entrepreneurship stream) degree from the University of Toronto in Fall 2024. I have previously worked as a Product Manager at TribalScale (Consulted for McCain) and as a QA Automation Engineer for theScore. I also have been working on my startup since my third year which focuses on spreading financial literacy for young adults. My specialties lie in CS Education Research, Product Management, System Design, AI/ML, Testing, and Software Entrepreneurship. On a side note, I love watching anime (favs: One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, and SpyXFamily) and dabbling with Indian Classical Music. Looking forward to a fantastic time with yâ€™all!
