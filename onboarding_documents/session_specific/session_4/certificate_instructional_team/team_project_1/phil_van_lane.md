I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at University of Toronto. My research focuses on leveraging machine learning and statistical methods to develop stellar dating methods using rotation and magnetic activity observations, with a focus on low-mass stars known as M-dwarfs. I am also a head TA for the largest undergraduate courses in Canada (AST101: The Sun and Its Neighbours; AST201: Stars and Galaxies)! From 2015 to 2022, I worked in various engineering consulting, software development, data engineering, and product management roles.
