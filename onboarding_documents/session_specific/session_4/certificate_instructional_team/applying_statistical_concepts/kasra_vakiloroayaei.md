Kasra's obsession with data started early, with collecting Basketball cards and comparing player Statistics against one another. This passion continued to fruition into an undergraduate degree in Statistics and Math at University of Toronto. Motivated to continue learning, he went on to continue to do his MSc at McGill university, with a thesis that focused on understanding how visit irregularity can bias a longitudinal study (Repeated measure study). While pursuing his MSc, he worked for Sanofi as a Statistician for their Data Science Manufacturing Technology team.
