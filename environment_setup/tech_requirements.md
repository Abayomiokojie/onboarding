# Technology Requirements 

## Computer 

Learners should have access to a personal computer <u>**with admin privileges**</u>. For a smooth experience running Python scripts and handling data throughout an entire session, consider the following minimum specifications:

  - **RAM:** At least 8GB. This ensures smooth operation when running multiple applications and handling data-intensive tasks.
  - **Storage:** A minimum of 50GB of available storage space. While an HDD is sufficient, an SSD is highly recommended for improved performance, especially when working with large datasets and multiple development environments.
  - **CPU:** A modern dual-core processor, such as an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3. This will efficiently handle development workloads and tasks involving Python packages and software tools.
  - **Operating System:** Any modern operating system that supports Python is required. This includes Windows 11 or newer, macOS (High Sierra 10.13 or newer), or a stable Linux distribution. Avoid using ChromeOS, Android OS, and iPadOS, as they are not suitable for out-of-the-box usage and require extensive setup that is not practical for most learners. Additionally, these operating systems are not widely used in the industry for these tasks.

## Internet Connection 

Reliable and high-speed internet access is essential for downloading software, accessing online materials, and participating in virtual classes. 

To ensure a smooth learning experience, we recommend a minimum internet connection speed of:

  * 10 Mbps Download
  * 5 Mbps Upload

## GitHub Account 

All module content will be housed on the DSI GitHub: https://github.com/UofT-DSI 

Learners must create a GitHub account if they don't already have one:

  * **Sign Up:** On the GitHub homepage, click the "Sign up" button.
  * **Create a GitHub Account:** Provide the necessary information:
    - **Username:** Choose a unique username that will identify you on GitHub.
    - **Email address:** Enter a valid email address.
    - **Password:** Create a secure password.
  * **Select the free plan.**

## Software Requirements 

Most of the technical requirements are addressed in the [environment_setup directory](../environment_setup/). Please refer to the document that corresponds to your operating system.
